TexasIntramurals
================
Texas Intramurals is the unofficial intramural sports tracker of the University of Texas at Austin. This app aims to be a more mobile friendly and intuitive experience than the UT Recsports website.

Please note: Texas Intramurals is not optimized for tablets yet. The app is still installable, but the views will be stretched.

##Core features:
- Follow the leagues you are interested in by starring them. Need to check an important score? Jump right to it by selecting the league in your "My leagues" page.
- View the full league table, not the truncated one that features on the recsports website.
- View dates, times, scores for every game, for every league for the entire semester, even playoffs!
